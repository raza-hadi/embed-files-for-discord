If your custom internet protocol has its own dedicated browser but you want to enable users to access it from other browsers like Chrome (or when they can't install your browser), here are a few strategies you can consider:

1. Develop a Browser Extension for Chrome
You can create a Chrome extension that recognizes and handles URLs using your custom protocol (e.g., myproto://). The extension could redirect users to your custom browser or display the content within Chrome.

Steps:

Create the Extension: Develop a simple extension using HTML, JavaScript, and the Chrome Extensions API.
Register the Protocol: Use the webRequest or chrome.declarativeNetRequest API to detect when a user enters a URL with your custom protocol.
Handle the URL: The extension can either:
Redirect to your custom browser via an external app launch.
Fetch and display the content within Chrome using an iframe or other mechanisms.
2. Use a Web Gateway for Your Protocol
Set up a web-based gateway that translates your custom protocol to HTTP/HTTPS, allowing users to access your content via a standard web browser.

How it works:

Users access your websites through a gateway URL like https://yourgateway.com/translate?url=myproto://example.
The gateway fetches the content using your protocol and displays it as a normal web page.
3. Integrate Your Protocol with Existing Browsers via URL Handlers
You can create a URL handler that allows existing browsers to launch your custom browser when a user clicks on a link using your protocol.

Windows Example:

Register your protocol in the Windows Registry so that itâ€™s recognized:
bash
Copy code
HKEY_CLASSES_ROOT\myproto\
(Default) = "URL:My Protocol"
URL Protocol = ""
Define how the protocol should be handled:
perl
Copy code
HKEY_CLASSES_ROOT\myproto\shell\open\command\
(Default) = "C:\path\to\your\browser.exe" "%1"
This allows any app or browser to open your custom protocol links by launching your browser.
4. Provide a Fallback Web Interface
If users cannot install your custom browser, offer a web interface that mimics the features of your custom protocol. You could:

Build a standard web version of your sites with URLs like https://yourwebsite.com/path.
Embed protocol-specific content or features using JavaScript or a backend system that converts your protocol to standard HTTP.
5. Cross-Platform App with WebView
For greater flexibility, create a cross-platform app using a technology like Electron or Flutter, which wraps your custom protocol browser in a WebView. Users could download this lightweight app to access your content without needing your full custom browser.

Conclusion
To support both your custom protocol and users who prefer traditional web browsers, combining a dedicated browser with a Chrome extension, a web gateway, or a URL handler can cover most scenarios. This hybrid approach ensures that even users without your browser can still access your content easily.
